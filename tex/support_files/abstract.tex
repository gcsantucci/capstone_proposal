	Statistical analysis in high energy physics experiments are most of the time trying to classify events into two classes, usually defined as signal and background classes. This proposal is particularly interested in studying applications of machine learning classifiers to optimize the separation of events coming from proton decay  and atmospheric neutrino interactions in the Super-Kamiokande experiment. SK has searched for the mode $p\rightarrow \bar{\nu}K^{+}$ in the prompt-gamma channel. The official results are used as a benchmark model to be improved in this work using machine learning methods.
